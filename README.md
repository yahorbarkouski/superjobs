# Gandi
> Stateful Reverse Proxy for decentralized IT jobs

Gandi shifts the closed-platform job search paradigm to a distributed, transparent and company-driven model, developing capabilities to create unique job search engines that **share the same source of content** but provide **different features** to retrieve and process it.

To make it simple, Gandi can be described as company job listings storage, that follow the following main principles:
- **Decentralized** – each company is responsible for its own job listings, that have been published on the company's website and pulled by Gandi;
- **Instant** – a single link to a company's job listing ensures seamless sync with Gandi repository, negating the need for manual content duplication;
- **Opensource** – all job listings are stored publicly and can be used by anyone for any purpose;
- **Consistent** – all job listings are synced with the company's website on a daily basis.

## Why?
Traditional job search tools tend to position themselves as intermediaries, but their approach often fragments the job market. Different job platforms publish unique sets of job listings, resulting in scattered and sometimes outdated information. This fragmented reality can mislead job-seekers and burden companies that struggle to keep listings up to date across multiple platforms.

Job search platforms operate more like a _black box_ than a practical tool. Companies face _competition_, huge costs for posting and advertising, and restrictions on how much information they can communicate about their vacancy.

Similarly, job-seekers struggle with _rigid search_ and filter options. Each platform restricts users to its pre-defined categories and keywords, leaving little room for a customised job search experience. In essence, these issues make job searching a daunting task rather than a smooth process.

The job search industry is also prohibitively difficult to enter from a startup solutions perspective because **it's rooted in the content problem**. We're sure there are a myriad of alternative approaches to filtering, sorting, personalised search and alerts, but they're all prohibitively difficult to implement for one simple reason: **the lack of an easy way to access corporate careers**.

### Does it have to be this way?
The unambiguous hiring goals of the company – to find the best-fit employee, and the job-seeker – to find the best-fit job, pushed us to the alternative solution space:
1. Job postings should be **as public as possible** – so that as many job-seekers as possible can find them;
2. Job platform business model **shouldn't cut off needy companies that cannot afford it**;
3. The more **personalised job search** and filtering tools that exist, the more candidates will be able to find the right vacancies;
4. Innovative job search systems **should answer the "How"** and **take the "What" for granted** to cover as many job-seeker preferences as possible.

## Approach comparison
To make sure we're on the same page, let's try to compare the traditional and alternative approaches to job search:

## Non-goals
We aim for ease of use, consistency and transparency, but there are certain areas Gandi explicitly does not target:

1. __To provide a strict copy of the company's original job listing__. Gandi consumers shouldn't act like a job application platforms, but rather as unique search engines. We completely accept aggregated information – a result of Gandi AI worker __and Contributor__ efforts – until that information is not violating the company's original job listing and easy to index dynamically.
2. Monetization of job posts – we don't earn profits from the data we don't own.
3. To compete with existing job search platforms. __Gandi is useless in a vacuum__. Our goal is simple – to provide information. And our information's goal is to be consumed by as many job search platforms as possible, nobody wins in the other case.

## Drawbacks and limitations
While we strive to create an alternative way for the job search process, we acknowledge the potential drawbacks of our system:

- Companies that have no job listings on their website __won't be able to use Gandi__, as we don't provide any job listing creation tools. At least for now;
- Some companies might have restrictions on sharing their job adverts outside their platforms, leading to potential legal issues. Such remarks seem strange to us, and we keep blindly follow the assumption that it's in the company's interest to get as much vacancy distribution as possible, but in any case – we can get it. We left a company deletion request form in the issues template and promise to handle such cases ASAP;
- Gandi accepts English-language job listings only.
